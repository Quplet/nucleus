# Nucleus

A small little fission physics simulation game made for the [Bevy Jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4).

This was my first project made in Bevy.

### How to play

1. Download the zip, extract the contents, and run the executable.
2. Select a level.
3. Left click to place a neutron, then left click to set its direction and velocity.
4. Space to begin the simulation.

You can right click an already placed neutron to pick it back up.
